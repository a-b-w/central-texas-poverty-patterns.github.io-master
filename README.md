## Description

Many secondary sources of community demographic data utilize the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s (USCB) American Community Survey (ACS) as a primary source of data. Since the ACS consists of a sample of the US population, the USCB provides uncertainty information with every ACS table. These are the margins of error (MOE), provided at a 90% confidence interval, included with every estimate. Margins of error become wider as the geographic level becomes smaller, or as we look at subsets of the population that are less frequent for that geography.  This may lead to certain challenges in the precise and accurate portrayal of this data, especially in maps. For example, values within the confidence bounds of an estimate (calculated by adding or subtracting the MOE to or from the estimate) that fall within the confidence bounds of another estimate may not be considered significantly different.

Providing some users with the ability to toggle between the estimate and its corresponding upper and lower estimates may help these users get a better understanding of the potential geographic extent of poverty. This may help organizations allocate resources more effectively by showing areas where data may be unreliable and secondary corroborative data may be necessary to determine if a need for services may exist in the area.
